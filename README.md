DESCRIPTION:
Blood Effects Make More Sense To What Enemies It Applies To, Also Less Blood On Some Corpse Textures

WHAT DOES THIS MOD CHANGE AND WHY?:
-Changes the "Blood Splash" texture for enemies that it made no sense to have spilling out blood, such as the Elemental Atronachs, Spriggan, Gargoyle, etc. 

-Alters the sprites of a good few corpse textures to make the amount of blood more believable and less obtrusive, the idea is less is more. Also changes a few corpse 
sprites that had clear mistakes, such as some of the Daedra corpses. As well as removing the blood from the corpses of enemies that it makes not sense to have blood at all.
